# UCCS CS5200 Computer Architecture Fall 2022 Research Paper

## Instructions

Select one paper from the most recent two years of the International Symposium on Computer Architecture [1] (ISCA).
Use it to find two related papers by checking the papers that it cites in its references and papers that cite it (using Google Scholar "cited by" feature).
Conduct this search transitively by checking other papers' "cited by" and references until you find two high-quality closely related papers.
Write critiques for the three papers.
You will submit these critiques separately.

Use these three papers to write a 4-8 page "mini-survey" research paper.
Your research paper should be written using the 2-column IEEE Conference template [2] with 11-point font. 
You must cite at least the 3 papers you critiqued, and any additional supporting citations or other related work you come across in your review of the literature.

-    Your research paper should have an Abstract, Introduction, Background, Related Work, Future Work, and Conclusion.
     Since you are not conducting experimental research, you do not need to have Design/Implementation/Experiments sections.
-    The Introduction should provide a clear motivation and problem statement for the surveyed material, and state the contribution of your paper; introduction section should only be about 10-15% of the paper, so about one to two columns.
-    The Background section should provide any supporting knowledge/content that is necessary to understand the surveyed material.
     This should be as "general knowledge" one might find in a textbook or primary source document, and should be relatively short (~10-15% of the paper).
-    The bulk of this paper should be the Related Work section (~40-50%).
     Unlike most academic papers, your mini-survey should have an expansive related work that goes into good detail on the 3 key papers you chose to address the problem area.
     This section will basically restate the 3 critiques you wrote, but do so in some organized fashion.
     You should also mention other related work beyond those 3 papers and summarize their contributions.
-    The most important part of this paper is the Future Work section and should be about 15-20% of the paper.
     In it, you should describe where you think the next work in this area ought to focus, and postulate some ways this might be done.
     Think of this as the start of a proposal to actually do the next work in this research area!
     Thus, it should be a synthesis across the related work, and it should not simply consist of stitching together future work from the 3 separate papers.
     You should look at the small body of work you surveyed and come up with some ideas for what should be next.
-    The conclusion should be quite small. Only a few sentences to wrap things up.

To find related work you should look at the references (bibliography) in the papers themselves, use the "Cited By" link in Google Scholar from a given paper and filter on publication year, or look in the conference proceedings from the last few years of ISCA, MICRO, ASPLOS, and HPCA.

# TL;DR

- [ ] Find a paper that doesn't suck.
- [ ] Then find two related papers.
- [ ] Critique all three.
- [ ] Write paper.
